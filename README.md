CAAL's Minimum Viable Product. The idea behind Context Awareness for Assisted Living is to apply activity recognition research in a way that helps people like you and me live a healthier life. Activity recognition, or "context awareness," is a hot research topic, but few labs have researched smartphone based systems and even fewer have released their datasets. In addition, there are few tools for developing machine learning models (the "black box" of activity recognition) which are relatively easy to port to mobile systems such as Android or iOS.

In order to overcome these challenges, CAAL is utilizing the WISDM Activity Recognition Dataset from Fordham University's Computer Science department to build its model(s). The Java based WEKA Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis suite is being used to do this.
